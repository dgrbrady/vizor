# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the "Interactive Code Visualization and REPL Environment" project.

## Structure:

- Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Phase directory names follow the convention: `Memory/Phase_X_Title_From_Plan/` (e.g., `Memory/Phase_1_Core_Project_Setup_Static_Code_Analysis_Foundation/`).
- Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.
- Task log file names follow the convention: `Task_[Phase.Task]_Short_Task_Description_Log.md` (e.g., `Task_1.1_SvelteKit_Setup_Log.md`).

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `apm/prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
